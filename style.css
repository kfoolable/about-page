/* From Mikayla:

"So here is one of the designs we are currently working on. Specifically for the About page. I would say this page is pretty simple as far as our designs go. They should be able to recreate just the About page using Bootstrap 4 or 5 as the framework. The navigation doesn't have to be functional or have any dropdowns, just set the link to #.

Let me know if they have any questions or issues.  */
